# **Real Estate Price Prediction**
Welcome to the Real Estate Price Prediction project! In this project, the goal is to develop a linear regression model to predict house prices per unit area based on various features associated with real estate transactions. The dataset comprises 414 entries, each containing valuable information about different properties.

By the end of this project, we aim to have a robust linear regression model that can provide accurate predictions of real estate prices based on the provided dataset. Let's embark on this exciting journey of real estate price prediction!
